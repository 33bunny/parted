Here is most of the steps we (maintainers) follow when making a release.

1. Execute build-aux/parted-release.  `parted-release --help` contains
   additional information.

2. Test the tarball.  Copy it to a few odd-ball systems and ensure that it
   builds and passes all tests.

3. Write the release announcement that will be posted to the mailing lists.
   There is a template generated at /tmp/announce-parted-$VERSION.

4. Run the gnupload command that was suggested by the release script.  You can
   find this at the end of release.log.

5. Wait a few minutes (maybe up to 30?) and then use the release URLs to
   download all tarball/signature pairs and use gpg --verify to ensure that
   they're all valid.  You will also need these URLs in the announcement mail.

6. Push the new tag with the following command:
     git push origin tag v$VERSION

7. Send the gpg-signed announcement mail, e.g.,
     To: info-gnu@gnu.org, parted-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org
     Cc: coordinator@translationproject.org, bug-parted@gnu.org
     Subject: parted-$v released [stable]
