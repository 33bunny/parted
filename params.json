{"name":"Parted","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.savannah.gnu.org/parted.git","body":"GNU Parted\r\n----------\r\n\r\nGNU Parted is a program for manipulating partition tables.\r\n\r\nWARNING: USING PARTED TO PERFORM FILE SYSTEM OPERATIONS IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nParted (post-2.4) no longer has the ability to create and modify file systems.\r\nUse file-system-specific tools to create and operate on file systems.\r\nFor example, use the e2fsprogs programs to operate on ext2, ext3 and ext4\r\nfile systems.  Use programs from the reiserfsprogs package if you want to\r\nmanipulate reiserfs file systems.  Although Parted lets you do some of the\r\nsame things, the file-system-related code in parted is not as robust as the\r\ncode in more specialized, FS-specific packages.\r\n\r\nMost FS-related functionality was removed after Parted 2.4.\r\nThus, the following commands are no longer supported:\r\nmkpartfs, mkfs, cp, move, check, resize.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.\r\n\r\n\r\n * documentation is in the doc/ directory.  The User's documentation is in\r\ntexinfo format, and is built into a format viewable by info/pinfo when\r\nyou run make.  To view the distributed texinfo documentation, run this:\r\n\r\n\t$ info -f parted.info\r\n\r\nOr view it on-line at:\r\n\r\n  http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/parted.html\r\n\r\n * the GNU Parted home page is http://www.gnu.org/software/parted\r\n * the GNU Parted FAQ can be found at\r\n   http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/faq.html\r\n * send bug reports, requests for help, feature requests, comments, etc. to\r\n   bug-parted@gnu.org.\r\n\r\nFor any copyright year range specified as YYYY-ZZZZ in this package\r\nnote that the range specifies every single year in that closed interval.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO DISTRIBUTIONS\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n(1) When compiling Parted for distribution for general use, we recommend using\r\nthe default configuration:\r\n\r\n\tCFLAGS=-Os ./configure\r\n\r\nThis includes --enable-debug (by default), which contains many assertions.\r\nObviously, these \"waste\" space, but in the past, they have caught potentially\r\ndangerous bugs before they would have done damage, so we think it's worth\r\nit.  Also, it means we get more bug reports ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) When doing dependencies, remember that libreiserfs is a *soft* dependency,\r\nso I guess that means Debian-look-alikes should do a \"suggests\", but\r\nnot a \"requires\".\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) When space is important, we suggest --without-readline, --disable-shared,\r\nand possibly --disable-nls and --disable-dynamic-loading.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
