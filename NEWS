* Noteworthy changes in release ?.? (????-??-??) [?]

** Improvements

  Parted now supports disks with sector size larger than 512 bytes.
  Before this release, Parted could operate only on disks with a sector
  size of 512 bytes.  However, disk manufacturers are already making disks
  with an exposed hardware sector size of 4096 bytes.  Prior versions of
  Parted cannot even read a partition table on such a device, not to
  mention create or manipulate existing partition tables.
  Due to internal design and time constraints, the following
  less-common partition table types are currently disabled:
    amiga, bsd, aix, pc98
  "bsd" and "amiga" are mostly done, but had a few minor problems,
  so may remain disabled until someone requests that they be revived.

** Bug fixes

  Partitions in a GPT table are no longer assigned the "microsoft
  reserved partition" type.  Before this change, each partition would
  be listed with a type of "msftres" by default.


* Noteworthy changes in release 1.9.0 (2009-07-23) [stable]

** Bug fixes

  parted now preserves the protective MBR (PMBR) in GPT type labels.

  http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-parted/2008-12/msg00015.html

  gpt_read now uses SizeOfPartitionEntry instead of the size of
  GuidPartitionEntry_t.  This ensures that *all* of the partition
  entries are correctly read.

  mklabel (interactive mode) now correctly asks for confirmation, when
  replacing an existent label, without outputting an error message.

    002739.html

  resize now handles FAT16 file systems with a 64k cluster.  This
  configuration is not common, but it is possible.
  http://parted.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/ticket/207

  parted now ignores devices of the type /dev/md* when probing.  These
  types of devices should be handled by the device-mapper capabilities
  of parted.
  http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/parted-devel/2009-April/\
    002781.html

  The parted documentation now describes the differences in the options
  passed to mkpart for the label types.

    002782.html

** Changes in behavior

  include/parted/beos.h, include/parted/gnu.h and include/parted/linux.h
  have been removed.  The symbols contained in these files (GNUSpecific,
  ped_device_new_from_store, BEOSSpecific, LinuxSpecific,  LINUX_SPECIFIC)
  were moved to the individual files that need them.

  In libparted, the linux-swap "filesystem" types are now called
  "linux-swap(v0)" and "linux-swap(v1)" rather than "linux-swap(old)"
  and "linux-swap(new)" as in parted 1.8, or "linux-swap" as in older
  versions; "old" and "new" generally make poor names, and v1 is the
  only format supported by current Linux kernels. Aliases for all
  previous names are available.

* Noteworthy changes in release 1.8.8.1 (2007-12-17) [stable]

** FIXME: fill in details

* Noteworthy changes in release 1.8.8 (2007-08-09) [stable]

** GNU parted is now licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3
   or higher.  See the COPYING file for more details.

** libparted:
  - Add compute_block_counts() to improve ext2fs support.
  - Properly detect 'ext2 fs too small' cases.
  - Move formatting commands out of translatable strings.
  - Read an msdos partition table from a device with 2K sectors.
  - Remove always-false "Unable to open" diagnostic in ped_disk_new(),
    leave the "unrecognized disk label" diagnostic.
  - Don't leak partition table buffer in amiga_read().
  - Don't read/write initialized memory with DEBUG turned on off for
    'mklabel bsd' and 'mklabel amiga' command calls.
  - Turn off DEBUG in libparted.c to avoid initializing all allocated
    memory to '1' bits.
  - Correct handling of HeaderSize field in GPT labels.
  - Fix block number used when checking for ext2 fs state.
  - Add detection support for Xen virtual block devices (/dev/xvd*).
  - When reading DASD labels, check the filesystem type as well as
    partition flags to determine what's on the partition.
  - Add _dm_probe_all() from Debian to probe for all device-mapper
    devices.

** parted:
  - Fixed exception handling in mkpart and mkpartfs commands.
  - Add the --dry-run option to the partprobe command.
  - Update docs: cannot specify 'primary' for a partition on a loop
    device.
  - Remove unused functions (get_spaces).
  - Fix off-by-one error in str_list_print_wrap().
  - Use xmalloc() and xrealloc() to check return values.
  - Fix invalid command line argument handling.
  - Close memory leaks in parted.c and table.c.
  - Fix warnings when compiling with translation support enabled.
  - Use a consistent prompt when asking for a file system type.
  - Update docs: don't reference old versions of gzip.

** misc:
  - Improve the testing framework in the tests/ subdirectory.  Build out
    more of the testing scripts so we can start using that to ensure we
    don't introduce regressions in releases.
  - Support testing with tmpfs filesystems on Linux.
  - Work around inadequate libreadline in the configure script.
  - Don't include config.h from internal headers.

* Noteworthy changes in release 1.8.7 (2007-05-09) [stable]

  - Suppress "you are not superuser..." warning in script mode.
  - Fix off-by-one bug in parted when displaying information about the
    disk.
  - Do not translate partition names in the 'parted print' command.
    This causes problems for non-Latin-based character sets.
  - Send errors to stderr rather than stdout.
  - Handle command line options independent of the order.
  - Abort on any invalid option and handle -v and -h first.
  - Only display the update /etc/fstab message when there has been a
    change to the disk (a shorter and more direct message too).

* Noteworthy changes in release 1.8.6 (2007-03-20) [stable]

** Revert the implementation of the linux-swap(new) and linux-swap(old) types.
   The type is 'linux-swap' for v1, v2, and s1suspend swap partitions on Linux.

* Noteworthy changes in release 1.8.5 (2007-03-20) [stable]

** Another minor update.  Both versions 1.8.3 and 1.8.4 lacked po translation
   files.  These are included with version 1.8.5.

* Noteworthy changes in release 1.8.4 (2007-03-19) [stable]
